# About Me
I am a mechanical engineer and self-taught developer passionate about automating things.

I've recently started to publish my thoughts on this page. I write mostly about ideas and concepts related to the Industrial Internet of Things.

I occasionally enjoy doing electronics projects (which has helped me solve quite some problems in industrial settings). I'm also interested in control theory and applications, especially when the math gets tricky! My main hobby though has now become web-programming, and I enjoy learning about frameworks and coding some apps here and there.

Completely unrelated, I enjoy reading about everything, specially about history and science in general.
