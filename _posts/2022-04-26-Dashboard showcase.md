# Dashboard showcase

I'm simply showing 3 images of very simple HTML dashboards I built in the past few months. They are very simple, only the one with the gantt chart was built with vuejs. I used plotly js for the graphics. The one with different devices and colors is a map of the plant with all the connected devices and their status; it's a simple SVG.

I might be posting the code for the dashboards in the future, but for the moment, only the pictures.
