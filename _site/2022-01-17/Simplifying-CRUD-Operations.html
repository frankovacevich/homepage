  <h1 id="simplifying-crud-operations">Simplifying CRUD operations</h1>

<p>The four basic database operations are Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD).</p>

<p>Typically, applications using HTTP use the request method (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE are the most common) to refer to a specific CRUD operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GET method = Read</li>
  <li>POST method = Create</li>
  <li>PUT method = Update</li>
  <li>DELETE method = Delete</li>
</ul>

<p>We can reduce this set of operations to two: READ and WRITE. This would make writing applications easier and allow more flexibility with the communication protocol used. This goes well with PUB/SUB (Publish / Subscribe) communication protocols (like MQTT). In this case, publishing would be equivalent to WRITE and subscribing to READ.</p>

<p>The READ operation would be the same as the Read operation in CRUD, whereas the WRITE operation would replace Create, Update and Delete.</p>

<p>Some database engines already provide an “<em>upsert</em>” method (Update + Insert). The user provides a record with an <em>id</em> and the database either updates the record with the same <em>id</em> or inserts a new record if the <em>id</em> is not found. This is a way of combining the Update and Create operations.</p>

<p>For example (this is pseudocode, where we call some READ and WRITE functions that represent the corresponding operations and we represent the records as json):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>WRITE({id: 1, value: 11})
READ() -&gt; [{id: 1, value: 11}]

WRITE({id: 2, value: 22})
READ() -&gt; [{id: 1, value: 11}, {id: 2, value: 22}]

WRITE({id: 1, value: 0})
READ() -&gt; [{id: 1, value: 0}, {id: 2, value: 22}]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the above example, we inserted two records with <em>ids</em> “1” and “2” and then updated the record with <em>id</em> “1” using only the WRITE function.</p>

<p>Finally, if we want to delete a record, we can set a field called, for example, “<em>deleted</em>”, that marks if the record has been deleted or not. This is a common practice when we want to keep all records even if the user “deletes” them from the front-end application. For instance, if an admin decides to delete a user, the back-end system will probably not remove the record for that user, but rather set a flag as “deleted”. This would allow for later recovery, among other benefits.</p>

<p>This means that the Delete operation becomes an Update operation, where we update the <em>deleted</em> field. We can do this again with our WRITE operation.</p>

<p>Continuing the above example:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>WRITE({id: 1, deleted: true})
READ() -&gt; [{id: 2, value: 22}]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The READ function ignores all the records that have the field “deleted” set to true.</p>

<p>With this, we have reduced the CRUD operation set to READ and WRITE.</p>
